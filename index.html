                                    Teams are at most 4 people. You can select teammates when you register, or you can register individually without specified teammates. We’ll run the lottery by teams, so rest assured you’ll be able to hack with your friends if that’s what you prefer!

The faction with the most points will win and get a surprise upon the conclusion of the hackathon.
