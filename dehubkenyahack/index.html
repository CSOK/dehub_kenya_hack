                                    If you’re travelling more than 30 miles to MIT, we’ll reimburse your travel, as long as you upload your travel receipts upon confirming your attendance. We reimburse up to $200 for travel within the U.S. and from Canada and Mexico and up to $500 for other international travel. We also provide buses free of charge to select East Coast cities.

The Red Faction and Blue Faction are hackathon-wide groups  that collectively complete challenges at DeHUB Kenya Hack 2017 for points.  The faction with the most points will win and get a surprise upon the conclusion of the hackathon.
